# TDAforcell
An application of Topological Data Analysis on cell table data

The Persistent Homology for the cell table can be generated by https://github.com/Yuhan0524/TDAforcell/blob/main/PHGeneration.py

After getting the Persistent Homology file, we can plot the Persistent Diagram by https://github.com/Yuhan0524/TDAforcell/blob/main/Persistent%20Diagram.py, trace back and visualize the cell distribution/image by https://github.com/Yuhan0524/TDAforcell/blob/main/Cell_Image_Visualization.ipynb

The vectorization method of the Persistent Homology Diagram is shown in https://github.com/Yuhan0524/TDAforcell/blob/main/Vectorization.py
